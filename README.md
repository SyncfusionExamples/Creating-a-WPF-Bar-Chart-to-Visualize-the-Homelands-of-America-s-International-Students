# Creating a WPF Bar Chart to Visualize the Homelands of America's International Students
A bar chart is used to display a distribution of data points or compare metric values across different subgroups of your data.

## Customization:
We can customize the color, border, and width of the bar chart using the [Palette](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartSeriesBase.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartSeriesBase_Palette),[Interior](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartSeriesBase.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartSeriesBase_Interior), [Stroke](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartSeries.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartSeries_Stroke), and [StrokeThickness](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartSeries.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartSeries_StrokeThickness) properties respectively.

## Watermark:
We can add any view to the plot area using [Watermark](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.SfChart.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_SfChart_Watermark) support, which is useful for adding any relevant data.

## Annotation:
[SfChart](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.SfChart.html) supports annotations, which allow you to mark specific areas of interest in the chart. You can add shapes, text, and images using [annotations](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/annotations).

This article demonstrates how to create a WPF Bar Chart to visualize where America's international students come from.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, colleges and universities in the U.S. witnessed a substantial decrease in the number of international students enrolling. However, in the academic year 2022â€“23, there has been a resurgence in the international student population, primarily attributed to a rise in students from India.

## Troubleshooting:
### Path too long exception:
If you encounter a path too long exception when building this example project, close Visual Studio and rename the repository to a shorter name before building the project.

For a step-by-step procedure, refer to the [Homelands of America's International Students blog](https://www.syncfusion.com/blogs/post/wpf-bar-chart-us-students.aspx).
